# Neighbor Joining for Orange

This project will implement [neighbor joining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_joining) for [Orange](https://github.com/biolab/orange3).

See Examples.ipynb for examples of use of functions in neighbor_joining.py. Some examples need data added to the data directory for them to work.

## Installation

To install, run `pip install .` or `pip install -e .`.

## neighbor_joining.py

### `tree = neighbor_joining(distance_matrix)`

Construct a tree structure from a distance matrix. The result is a dictionary `{index1: [[index2, distance], ...], ...}`.

### `rooted_tree = rooted(tree, root=0)`

Make all connections one-directional and reachable from root. The root node is `0` by default but can be provided as the second argument.

**Note**: At the moment the root node doesn't get a label.

### `points = get_points(rooted_tree, root=0)`

Get coordinates of points. The result is a dictionary `{index: [x, y], ...}`. The root node is `0` by default but can be provided as the second argument. It must match the root that was given to `rooted`.

### `plot(rooted_tree, points, labels=[], classes=None)`

Draws the tree. Keyword argument `classes` is a list of lists of indexes. Lists of indexes contain indexes of nodes of the same class. They will be colored with the same color. Keyword argument `labels` is a list of strings which are displayed on the plot next to nodes with corresponding indexes.
